# Universal Boosting Variational Inference

This is unofficial Pytorch implementation of Universal Boosting Variational Inference. Based on unfinished authorâ€™s implementation on Numpy: https://github.com/trevorcampbell/ubvi

The project is based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01235.pdf

The proposal for the project may be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/7769475349bxtstwpmmzsq

## Requirements

```
PyTorch 1.3.0
numpy 1.14
matplotlib
```

## Project goals

During the project, we are going to:

1. Implement algorithm in PyTorch;
2. Replicate experiments states in the paper with UBVI (synthesised data from Cauchy and banana distributions);
3. Implement BBVI;
4. Compare results.

## How to use

```
python test_ubvi.py
```
```
python test_bbvi.py
```
The resulting graphs will be in the results folder.

```experiment_distributions.ipynb``` - notebook with experiments for report
