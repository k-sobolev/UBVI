# UBVI
## Pytorch implementation of Universal Boosting Variational Inference

The project is based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01235.pdf

The proposal for the project may be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/7769475349bxtstwpmmzsq


## Project goals
Currently, paper has an official repository: www.github.com/trevorcampbell/ubvi. However, currently algorithm is implemented using Numpy library and not not finished.

During the project, we are going to:

1. Implement algorithm in Pytorch;
2. Compare efficiency with Numpy implementation (training time, inference speed);
3. Replicate experiments states in the paper (synthesised data from Cauchy and banana distributions);
4. Conduct experiments with more types on synthetic data;
5. Conduct additional experiments on real datasets;
6. Compare results with non-boosting models.
