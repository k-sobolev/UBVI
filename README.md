# Universal Boosting Varitional Inference

This is unofficial Pytorch implementation of Universal Boosting Variational Inference

The project is based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01235.pdf

The proposal for the project may be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/7769475349bxtstwpmmzsq

The presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U1OPyvEx97d3yEUld0rSrA6vNYsNDSrqel1fOZjFXjw/edit#slide=id.g641ef2860b_3_192

## Requirements

```
PyTorch 1.3.0
numpy 1.14
matplotlib
```

## Project goals

During the project, we are going to:

1. Implement algorithm in PyTorch;
2. Replicate experiments states in the paper with UBVI (synthesised data from Cauchy and banana distributions);
3. Implement BBVI;
4. Compare results.

## How to use

```
python test.py
```
The resulting graphs will be in the results folder
